		<p> Manager Jose Mourinho and midfielder Ander Herrera both offered no excuses for the disappointing defeat at Huddersfield Town. Yes, there is a long injury list, added to when Phil Jones limped off with the score still at 0-0, and a Champions League trip to Lisbon that necessitated a return in the wee small hours of Thursday morning. Plus the horrible weather in west Yorkshire. Yet the simple fact of the matter was United deserved to lose our first game of the season because of what happened out on the pitch. It happens, the manager even talked about it in his pre-match press conference this week.</p>

	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">If you have criticism for not losing, I can imagine, because we are going to lose - that's obvious that we are going to lose matches - that we are going to have even more criticism than we have now. But, honestly, it's no problem." The Londoners will provide a stern test at Old Trafford but, with the fans right behind the Reds in the early kick-off, a victory would get us very much back on track. While it is important City do not establish too commanding a lead in the table, let us not forget that so much can change in a short space of time and a quick glance at December's hectic schedule provides possible evidence of that.</p>
